Generally, this can happen due to a few possible events: When  adding a custom token : You specified an incorrect token contract address (resulting in an attempt to send a token that you have none of). You specified an incorrect token decimal (e.g., inadvertently attempting to send 50,000,000 of a token as opposed to 5,000 of it).

When do I get my ETH back? When a transaction fails due to a  Bad jump destination  or  Out of Gas  error, the ETH never actually leaves your account.

The easiest way to check your balance is actually not by unlocking your wallet. You only need your address in order to see your balance.

Ether (ETH) is the fuel for that network. When you send tokens, interact with a contract, send ETH, or do anything else on the blockchain, you must pay for that computation.

ICOs can create quite a mess of the transaction (TX) pool. This sometimes results in an accumulation of pending TXs that take longer than normal to send, and is a network issue that affects all exchanges and clients.
