The ETH is stored on the blockchain. Your private key, Keystore file, or whatever piece of information you have proves ownership of that ETH, which allows you to move it. At the end of the day, you are always signing with your private key. However, for additional functionality (like protecting it with a password), there are different formats and ways of storing your private key: MetaMask Learn More Here…"}},{"title":"Ethereum Address Has Uppercase and Lowercase Letters","slug":"general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/ethereum-address-has-uppercase-and-lowercase-letters","childMdx":{"excerpt":"What does it mean if my address has uppercase and lowercase letters?

They are also not included directly in the blockchain; they are value transfers that were initiated by executing a smart contract (smart contract Ether or token transfer). Certain Ether and token transfers require calling a smart contract to perform the action. These show up as internal transactions and are not indicated in the main ETH…"}},{"title":"What is nonce?","slug":"general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/what-is-nonce","childMdx":{"excerpt":"In Ethereum, every transaction has a nonce. The nonce is the number of transactions sent from a given address. Each time you send a transaction, the nonce increases by  1 . There are rules about what transactions are valid, and the nonce is used to enforce some of these rules. Specifically: Transactions must be in order:  You cannot have a transaction with a nonce of  1  mined before one with a nonce of  0 . No skipping!  You cannot have a transaction with a nonce of  2  mined if you have not…"}},{"title":"What is WalletConnect?","slug":"general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/what-is-walletconnect","childMdx":{"excerpt":"WalletConnect is an open protocol made to facilitate a secure connection between mobile cryptocurrency wallets and desktop applications, such as dapps. Transactions are made through an encrypted connection by scanning a QR code, and are confirmed on the mobile device.
